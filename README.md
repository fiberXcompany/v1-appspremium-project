I've created a responsive gaming website clone that closely resembles the original design. The site includes:

1. A header with navigation links
2. A hero carousel with promotional banners
3. Service icons for different sections
4. A grid of popular games
5. Payment options section
6. Promotional cards with pricing
7. A safety banner section
8. Features section explaining the benefits
9. A comprehensive footer


The website is fully responsive and works on both mobile and desktop. I've used Tailwind CSS for styling and Next.js for the framework. The components are organized in a modular way, making it easy to maintain and extend.
